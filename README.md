# 🤖 Alexa Joke Teller Skill

## Overview
This is a custom Alexa skill designed to entertain users by telling them random jokes. Developed as one of my first major coding projects at age 13, this skill introduced me to voice-based applications and the Amazon Alexa ecosystem.

## Features
- Responds to user voice commands with a random joke.
- Uses Amazon Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) and AWS Lambda.
- Simple and engaging user experience with humorous content.

## Technologies Used
- **Amazon Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)**
- **AWS Lambda (Node.js or Python)**
- **Amazon Developer Console**
- **JSON for intent schema and sample utterances**

## How It Works
1. User says: “Alexa, tell me a joke from Adi's Jokebook.”
2. Alexa invokes the skill and triggers a Lambda function.
3. The function selects a joke from a predefined list.
4. Alexa speaks the joke to the user.

## Future Improvements
- Add joke categories (e.g., tech, puns, dad jokes).
- Integrate with a jokes API for dynamic content.
- Add voice personalization features.
